# Next.js + Jest

![Screenshot](/assets/screenshot.png)

Task
- Create an Integer to Roman Numeral Calculator
- The web application should have one input field, where the user can enter a number between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- The web application should have one output section, where the converted roman numeral is shown based on his input.
- Create a new repository and initialize it with the following command, this will bootstrap a Next.JS application with all necessary libraries and test suites for this task
- npx create-next-app --example with-jest with-jest-app
- Push your code to a public repository and share us a link to that repository

What we would like to see / Definition of Done
- Production ready code - Whatever this means to you
- In order to understand your progress, create as many meaningful commits as possible.
Consider that an intern is joining your team and he/she has to take over your code. He is not familiar with the techstack, but should be able to onboard himself.

What we do NOT expect as part of this coding challenge
- Styling / CSS - Keep it simple and focus on the actual logic
- SEO / SSR / ISR
- Server-Side calculation / API / REST-Usage
- CI/CD-Setup
- Deployment

Some of the things we pay attention to
- In which way did you code your application? Did you follow any Software Development principles? (That is why we are requesting as many meaningful commits as possible to understand your approach.)
- Does your code follow the Clean Code principles?
- Does the code follow SOLID?
- Can someone onboard himself?

This example shows how to configure Jest to work with Next.js.

This includes Next.js' built-in support for Global CSS, CSS Modules and TypeScript.

## How to Use

Quickly get started using [Create Next App](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app#readme)!

In your terminal, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-jest with-jest-app
```

```bash
yarn create next-app --example with-jest with-jest-app
```

```bash
pnpm create next-app --example with-jest with-jest-app
```

## Run Jest Tests
